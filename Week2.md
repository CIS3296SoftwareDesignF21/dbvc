## Looking Forward: Week 3
What are you working on until the next meeting? What is getting in your way or keeping you from doing your job?

### Anna
### Rachel
### Lin Li
- I will probably have to find a more generalized approach to adding roles to users based on associated emojis. Currently
the emojis are mapped to role IDs that are specific to our test server. I want to look into adding a place for
server owners to add their own role IDs into a configuration file and then using environmental variables within the code itself.
