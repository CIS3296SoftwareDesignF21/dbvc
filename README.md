# Project Description
The Discord Bot for Virtual Coven is a JavaScript and Java-based Discord bot that will be used in the management of Discord servers related to a virtual coven (i.e. groups interested in witchcraft). The goal of the bot is to help with user initiation into the server, as well as moderation and notification of users of important dates (such as lunar events) that may be important or noteworthy, as well as helping to monitor some channels to ensure a safe community place for all members.

Maria, age 34, is a current grad student studying philosophy. She comes from Boston, MA, but relocated to Indiana for graduate study. She recently has been interested in learning more about witchcraft but has not been able to find a welcoming community in her current location, and the COVID-19 pandemic has made traveling to meet with others more difficult. She is interested in finding some sort of community online that would be welcoming and easily accessible. Maria has never used Discord for instant messaging, video calls, or text messaging, and her main forms of online communication are simply emails. If Maria used the Luna Bot, she would be able to easily connect with a community that would make her feel welcome in her new interests.
